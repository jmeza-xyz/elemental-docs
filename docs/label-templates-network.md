## Network Template Variables

The information collected in the Network template variables defines attributes of the network
interfaces available in the system.

The NICs are tracked both by number (0, 1, 2, ...) and by interface name (_eth0_, _virbr0_, ...).

The IPv4Addresses and IPv6Addresses are tracked by number (0, 1, ...) and the first IPv4 and IPv6
address entries (i.e., IPv4Addresses.0 and IPv6Addresses.0) are tracked in the IPv4Address and the
IPv6Address variables.

For example, if `${Network/NICs/2/Name}` is equal to `eth0`, then the network interface
Mac Address can be retrieved via both the `${Network/NICs/2/MacAddress}` and the
`${Network/NICs/eth0/MacAddress}` variables.

`eth0` (first) IPv4 address can be retrieved with both the `${Network/NICs/eth0/IPv4Address}`
and the `${Network/NICs/eth0/IPv4Addresses/0}` variables.
The secondary `eth0` IPv4 address can be retrieved with `${Network/NICs/eth0/IPv4Addresses/1}` instead.
